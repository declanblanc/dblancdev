## Coding/Tech Adjacent

These are channels that may be tech focused, but not entirely focused on programming.

- [Dave's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesGarage) - David Plummer! Former Microsoft engineer, his claim to fame is [Windows task manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve95Nh690l0)! He's also very open about his autism and has written two books on the topic, neat!

## Math & Science

These channels are mostly focused on math and science.

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) - Linear algebra and machine learning (and more probably)

# How I block apps & websites on my computer

_Trying my best to stay focused and mindful of how I spend my time._

....

Using an app called [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/), I have created the following blocks on my computer. They are all password protected by my wife, so I get to bug her if I ever need something unblocked, or to add new blocks.

> 💡
> This is a setup that happens to work for me right now.
>
> It's "missing" a lot of things that other people would probably want to block.
>
> It is a system that is constantly changing and evolving, and will never be "perfect".

> I bother my lovely wife at least once every two weeks to type in her pin so that I can adjust something. Typically this is when I catch myself spending too much time on a particular platform. This is just the current iteration.
